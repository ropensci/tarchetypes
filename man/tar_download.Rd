\arguments{
\item{name}{Symbol, name of the target.
In \code{\link[targets:tar_target]{tar_target()}}, \code{name} is an unevaluated symbol, e.g.
\code{tar_target(name = data)}.
In \code{\link[targets:tar_target_raw]{tar_target_raw()}}, \code{name} is a character string, e.g.
\code{tar_target_raw(name = "data")}.

A target name must be a valid name for a symbol in R, and it
must not start with a dot. Subsequent targets
can refer to this name symbolically to induce a dependency relationship:
e.g. \code{tar_target(downstream_target, f(upstream_target))} is a
target named \code{downstream_target} which depends on a target
\code{upstream_target} and a function \code{f()}. In addition, a target's
name determines its random number generator seed. In this way,
each target runs with a reproducible seed so someone else
running the same pipeline should get the same results,
and no two targets in the same pipeline share the same seed.
(Even dynamic branches have different names and thus different seeds.)
You can recover the seed of a completed target
with \code{tar_meta(your_target, seed)} and run \code{\link[targets:tar_seed_set]{tar_seed_set()}}
on the result to locally recreate the target's initial RNG state.}

\item{urls}{Character vector of URLs to track and download.
Must be known and declared before the pipeline runs.}

\item{paths}{Character vector of local file paths to
download each of the URLs.
Must be known and declared before the pipeline runs.}

\item{method}{Method to be used for downloading files.  Current
    download methods are \code{"internal"}, \code{"libcurl"},
    \code{"wget"}, \code{"curl"} and \code{"wininet"} (Windows
    only), and there is a value \code{"auto"}: see \sQuote{Details} and
    \sQuote{Note}.

    The method can also be set through the option
    \code{"download.file.method"}: see \code{\link{options}()}.
  }

\item{quiet}{If \code{TRUE}, suppress status messages (if any), and
    the progress bar.}

\item{mode}{character.  The mode with which to write the file.  Useful
    values are \code{"w"}, \code{"wb"} (binary), \code{"a"} (append) and
    \code{"ab"}.  Not used for methods \code{"wget"} and \code{"curl"}.
    See also \sQuote{Details}, notably about using \code{"wb"} for Windows.
  }

\item{cacheOK}{logical.  Is a server-side cached value acceptable?}

\item{extra}{character vector of additional command-line arguments for
    the \code{"wget"} and \code{"curl"} methods.}

\item{headers}{named character vector of additional HTTP headers to
    use in HTTP[S] requests.  It is ignored for non-HTTP[S] URLs.  The
    \code{User-Agent} header taken from the \code{HTTPUserAgent} option
    (see \code{\link{options}}) is automatically used as the first header.}

\item{iteration}{Character of length 1, name of the iteration mode
of the target. Choices:
\itemize{
\item \code{"vector"}: branching happens with \code{vctrs::vec_slice()} and
aggregation happens with \code{vctrs::vec_c()}.
\item \code{"list"}, branching happens with \verb{[[]]} and aggregation happens with
\code{list()}.
\item \code{"group"}: \code{dplyr::group_by()}-like functionality to branch over
subsets of a non-dynamic data frame.
For \code{iteration = "group"}, the target must not by dynamic
(the \code{pattern} argument of \code{\link[targets:tar_target]{tar_target()}} must be left \code{NULL}).
The target's return value must be a data
frame with a special \code{tar_group} column of consecutive integers
from 1 through the number of groups. Each integer designates a group,
and a branch is created for each collection of rows in a group.
See the \code{\link[targets:tar_group]{tar_group()}} function to see how you can
create the special \code{tar_group} column with \code{dplyr::group_by()}.
}}

\item{error}{Character of length 1, what to do if the target
stops and throws an error. Options:
\itemize{
\item \code{"stop"}: the whole pipeline stops and throws an error.
\item \code{"continue"}: the whole pipeline keeps going.
\item \code{"null"}: The errored target continues and returns \code{NULL}.
The data hash is deliberately wrong so the target is not
up to date for the next run of the pipeline. In addition,
as of version 1.8.0.9011, a value of \code{NULL} is given
to upstream dependencies with \code{error = "null"} if loading fails.
\item \code{"abridge"}: any currently running targets keep running,
but no new targets launch after that.
\item \code{"trim"}: all currently running targets stay running. A queued
target is allowed to start if:
\enumerate{
\item It is not downstream of the error, and
\item It is not a sibling branch from the same \code{\link[targets:tar_target]{tar_target()}} call
(if the error happened in a dynamic branch).
}

The idea is to avoid starting any new work that the immediate error
impacts. \code{error = "trim"} is just like \code{error = "abridge"},
but it allows potentially healthy regions of the dependency graph
to begin running.

to learn how to debug targets using saved workspaces.)
}}

\item{memory}{Character of length 1, memory strategy. Possible values:
\itemize{
\item \code{"auto"}: new in \code{targets} version 1.8.0.9011, \code{memory = "auto"}
is equivalent to \code{memory = "transient"} for dynamic branching
(a non-null \code{pattern} argument) and \code{memory = "persistent"}
for targets that do not use dynamic branching.
\item \code{"persistent"}: the target stays in memory
until the end of the pipeline (unless \code{storage} is \code{"worker"},
in which case \code{targets} unloads the value from memory
right after storing it in order to avoid sending
copious data over a network).
\item \code{"transient"}: the target gets unloaded
after every new target completes.
Either way, the target gets automatically loaded into memory
whenever another target needs the value.
}

For cloud-based dynamic files
(e.g. \code{format = "file"} with \code{repository = "aws"}),
the \code{memory} option applies to the
temporary local copy of the file:
\code{"persistent"} means it remains until the end of the pipeline
and is then deleted,
and \code{"transient"} means it gets deleted as soon as possible.
The former conserves bandwidth,
and the latter conserves local storage.}

\item{garbage_collection}{Logical: \code{TRUE} to run \code{base::gc()}
just before the target runs,
\code{FALSE} to omit garbage collection.
In the case of high-performance computing,
\code{gc()} runs both locally and on the parallel worker.
All this garbage collection is skipped if the actual target
is skipped in the pipeline.
Non-logical values of \code{garbage_collection} are converted to \code{TRUE} or
\code{FALSE} using \code{isTRUE()}. In other words, non-logical values are
converted \code{FALSE}. For example, \code{garbage_collection = 2}
is equivalent to \code{garbage_collection = FALSE}.}

\item{deployment}{Character of length 1. If \code{deployment} is
\code{"main"}, then the target will run on the central controlling R process.
Otherwise, if \code{deployment} is \code{"worker"} and you set up the pipeline
with distributed/parallel computing, then
the target runs on a parallel worker. For more on distributed/parallel
computing in \code{targets}, please visit
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/crew.html}.}

\item{priority}{Numeric of length 1 between 0 and 1. Controls which
targets get deployed first when multiple competing targets are ready
simultaneously. Targets with priorities closer to 1 get dispatched earlier
(and polled earlier in \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}).}

\item{resources}{Object returned by \code{tar_resources()}
with optional settings for high-performance computing
functionality, alternative data storage formats,
and other optional capabilities of \code{targets}.
See \code{tar_resources()} for details.}

\item{storage}{Character string to control when the output of the target
is saved to storage. Only relevant when using \code{targets}
with parallel workers (\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/crew.html}).
Must be one of the following values:
\itemize{
\item \code{"main"}: the target's return value is sent back to the
host machine and saved/uploaded locally.
\item \code{"worker"}: the worker saves/uploads the value.
\item \code{"none"}: \code{targets} makes no attempt to save the result
of the target to storage in the location where \code{targets}
expects it to be. Saving to storage is the responsibility
of the user. Use with caution.
}}

\item{retrieval}{Character string to control when the current target
loads its dependencies into memory before running.
(Here, a "dependency" is another target upstream that the current one
depends on.) Only relevant when using \code{targets}
with parallel workers (\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/crew.html}).
Must be one of the following values:
\itemize{
\item \code{"main"}: the target's dependencies are loaded on the host machine
and sent to the worker before the target runs.
\item \code{"worker"}: the worker loads the target's dependencies.
\item \code{"none"}: \code{targets} makes no attempt to load its
dependencies. With \code{retrieval = "none"}, loading dependencies
is the responsibility of the user. Use with caution.
}}

\item{cue}{An optional object from \code{tar_cue()} to customize the
rules that decide whether the target is up to date.}

\item{description}{Character of length 1, a custom free-form human-readable
text description of the target. Descriptions appear as target labels
in functions like \code{\link[targets:tar_manifest]{tar_manifest()}} and \code{\link[targets:tar_visnetwork]{tar_visnetwork()}},
and they let you select subsets of targets for the \code{names} argument of
functions like \code{\link[targets:tar_make]{tar_make()}}. For example,
\code{tar_manifest(names = tar_described_as(starts_with("survival model")))}
lists all the targets whose descriptions start with the character
string \code{"survival model"}.}
}
\value{
A list of two target objects, one upstream and one downstream.
The upstream one watches a URL for changes, and the downstream one
downloads it.
See the "Target objects" section for background.
}
\description{
Create a target that downloads file from one or more URLs
and automatically reruns when the remote data changes
(according to the ETags or last-modified time stamps).
}
\details{
\code{tar_download()} creates a pair of targets, one upstream
and one downstream. The upstream target uses \code{format = "url"}
(see \code{targets::tar_target()}) to track files at one or more URLs,
and automatically invalidate the target if the ETags
or last-modified time stamps change. The downstream target
depends on the upstream one, downloads the files,
and tracks them using \code{format = "file"}.
}
\section{Target objects}{

Most \code{tarchetypes} functions are target factories,
which means they return target objects
or lists of target objects.
Target objects represent skippable steps of the analysis pipeline
as described at \url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/}.
Please read the walkthrough at
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html}
to understand the role of target objects in analysis pipelines.

For developers,
\url{https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html#target-factories}
explains target factories (functions like this one which generate targets)
and the design specification at
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets-design/}
details the structure and composition of target objects.
