Package: tarchetypes
Title: Archetypes for Targets
Description: Function-oriented Make-like declarative pipelines for
  Statistics and data science are supported in the 'targets' R package.
  As an extension to 'targets', the 'tarchetypes' package provides
  convenient user-side functions to make 'targets' easier to use.
  By establishing reusable archetypes for common kinds of
  targets and pipelines, these functions help express complicated
  reproducible pipelines concisely and compactly.
  The methods in this package were influenced by the 'targets' R package.
